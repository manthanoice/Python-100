## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

    'function':'TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY',
    'symbol':STOCK,
    'interval':'60min',

}

the_request = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=the_params)

the_request.status_code

the_data = the_request.json()

today = float(the_data['Time Series (60min)']['2021-12-31 12:00:00']['4. close'])
yesterday = float(the_data['Time Series (60min)']['2021-12-30 12:00:00']['4. close'])

print('Today is: {}'.format(today))
print('Yesterday is: {}'.format(yesterday))

diff = abs(yesterday - today)

the_perc = round((diff/ yesterday) * 100, 2)

print(the_perc)


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

news_api = 'c11b2b15d0384ed3b8a3e1f0ca3a580a'
news_params = {
    'q':COMPANY_NAME,
    'apiKey':news_api
}
if the_perc > 1:

    the_news = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT,params=news_params)

    the_news.raise_for_status

    articles = the_news.json()['articles']

    three_articles = articles[:3]
    for i in range(3):
        print('\n')
        the_title = three_articles[i]['title']
        the_desc = three_articles[i]['description']
        print(the_title)    



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
